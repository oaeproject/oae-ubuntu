Installing OAE on Ubuntu from Packages
======================================

You can use a few PPAs and manually download a single .deb to install OAE and its dependencies on Ubuntu:

    wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.2.deb
    sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-0.90.2.deb
    sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://debian.datastax.com/community stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list"
    curl -L http://debian.datastax.com/debian/repo_key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oae/deps
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oae-full
    # bunyan isn't strictly necessary, but will make the logs more readable
    sudo apt-get install build-essential make
    sudo npm install -g bunyan

You'll now have to configure nginx and hilary. See the instructions in the `Configuration` section of https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/blob/master/README.md the nginx template is in `/opt/3akai-ux/optimized/nginx` and the hilary `config.js` is in `/opt/oae`.

Building new package versions
=============================

  * To push an update, you'll have to download the original sources from which to generate a diff. See the Hilary update section below as an example. If you perform an update of a project that is not documented here, please document it!
  * Copy the code that should go into the package into the appropriate source directory
  * cd in and run something like `debchange -v <package name>_<version>` to add an entry to the changelog
  * run `debuild -S` to build the changes file (if your package has binary files, this will be more difficult. See Hilary section below for an example of dealing with binary files)
  * cd up to the parent directory and run `dput ppa:oae/deps <package name>_<version>_source.changes` to put it in the PPA.

Packaging a Hilary update
=========================

  * Download the `hilary_0.2.0.orig.tar.gz` from the PPA into the `hilary` directory (sibling to `hilary-src`)
  * Overwrite the whole `hilary-src` contents with the output from the `grunt release:dist` Hilary command, but leave the `hilary-src/debian` directory in tact
  * `cd` into `hilary-src` and run `debchange -v <version>` (e.g., `debchange -v 0.2.0-3`) to add an entry to the changelog. The formatting of the comments, header and signature of log are **very sensitive** keep spacing exact
  * Create a patch for the new changes by running this:

`dpkg-source --commit --extend-diff-ignore="(.*\.a|.*\.o|.*\.node|.*\.t?gz|.*\.bz2|.*\.ico|.*/bin/phantomjs)$"`

Note that the `--extend-diff-ignore` flag is telling the patch generator to ignore all binary files. If later a new binary file gets introduced that does not match this pattern, you will receive errors during this step that say something like:

```
dpkg-source: error: cannot represent change to hilary-src/node_modules/cas-sfu/node_modules/xml2json/node_modules/node-expat/build/Release/obj.target/deps/libexpat/libexpat.a: binary file contents changed
dpkg-source: error: add node_modules/cas-sfu/node_modules/xml2json/node_modules/node-expat/build/Release/obj.target/deps/libexpat/libexpat.a in debian/source/include-binaries if you want to store the modified binary in the debian tarball
```

In which case you will have to update the filter to match the new binary files.

  * run `debuild -S --source-option=--include-binaries` to build the changes file. This also lists all the binary files into the `debian/include-binaries` file
  * `cd` up to the parent directory and run `dput ppa:oae/deps hilary_<version>_source.changes` (e.g., `dput ppa:oae/deps hilary_0.2.0-3_source.changes`) to put it in the PPA.
